# Day Scheduler

## Description

My motivation for the following project was to build a day scheduler website. Constructing a day scheduler website is helpful for many coders since it is a typical interview project. This website helped me learn javascript, along with jquery and bootstrap. I built this project to test my javascript skills and learn more about coding and web development.
